/**
 * MinecraftForge mods' fluid interactions, asked from NeoForge's walk when a block next to a liquid changes
 * (FluidInteractionsInjector).
 *
 * <p>The merged {@code LiquidBlock.onPlace} is MinecraftForge's and asks MinecraftForge's registry itself, as on
 * MinecraftForge. The merged {@code neighborChanged} is NeoForge's and asks NeoForge's registry, which walks the
 * neighbours and, at each, its rules — vanilla's two, then NeoForge mods'. Where those run out at one neighbour, it asks
 * {@link #minecraftForge} about the same neighbour: MinecraftForge's walk has a mod's rule at a neighbour beat vanilla's
 * at a later one, and so does this. MinecraftForge's own copies of vanilla's rules are skipped, since NeoForge's identical
 * ones were just asked about that neighbour; what can match here is a MinecraftForge mod's rule.
 *
 * <p>MinecraftForge's registry hands its map over at the end of its initializer, when it holds only those copies
 * ({@link #minecraftForgeRegistry}), and its {@code addInteraction} reports every later add ({@link #minecraftForgeInUse}).
 * Until a MinecraftForge mod adds a rule, a neighbour change is answered without a lookup — a game with no such mod pays
 * nothing for it, and never loads the class from here.
 *
 * <p>A rule that does not link — a MinecraftForge class or member the merged game lacks — is reported once and then left
 * out, so liquids keep NeoForge's answer rather than failing every neighbour change. Anything a mod's own rule throws is
 * the mod's, and propagates as it would on MinecraftForge.
